Owing to its sense of responsibility to look after the people of Hong Kong, the British set up the British Relief Council in Guangdong province, [in the] south of mainland China. This was the nearest safe point from which the British could help refugees from their “colony”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/0c742914-180c-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_1320x770_112248.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two professors from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) successfully fled Hong Kong for Free China in February 1942. They were Professor Gordon King and Professor Linsay Ride. Professor King managed to gain the support of the Chinese government and the British authorities to set up the HKU Relief Council. And together with Professor Ride, they carefully coordinated escape plans to help HKU students find safe passage into Free China. Once the students arrived in China, the HKU Relief Council would help make arrangements for them to resume their studies.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Singapore pilot, 99, on wartime Hong Kong and being a Flying Tiger</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While many of us were preparing our supplies for the escape, a young Burmese boy of ethnic Chinese origin approached us. He was too young to be a university student. Nonetheless, he brought us news that his relative, Aw Boon Haw, wanted to meet the students of HKU. Aw Boon Haw and his brother, Aw Boon Par, were famous throughout Asia for their family’s medicinal balm that could alleviate all kinds of aches and pains. It was known as Tiger Balm and the Aw brothers had amassed a fortune manufacturing and selling it. We were all very excited that Aw Boon Haw wanted to meet us. And I was quite lucky to be in the delegation that went to meet him in his grand villa at Causeway Bay, where he graciously offered us tea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/08f4eeba-180a-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_600x_112248.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over tea, he told us: “You young people have the right idea in going to China. I would like all of you to have the opportunity to go to China because that is where the future is. For those of you who want to go, I would like to offer you some financial assistance. I wish you all the best of luck.” With that, he gave each of us a HK$500 loan, and told us that we can repay him when we are able to do so. He called it a “loan” in order to save our pride, but it was clearly a gift, as he did not require us to sign any documents. After which, he directed his staff to provide us whatever medical items we needed from his store. We left Causeway Bay that evening overwhelmed with gratitude and joy at the generosity of the man.

Lau was from Malaya, and he had completed his third year of medical studies when the Japanese invaded. Chiang was an arts student who grew up in Hong Kong, and he was also the agent who had briefed us in the previous two meets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The atmosphere was incredibly tense. There was hope, yet a lot of anxiety and fear. What if we got caught? We had heard of a fellow student who was caught by the Japanese and killed out in the open, in full view of everyone on the streets. He was not given a chance to explain himself. There was no trial, only a swift execution with a bullet through the head. This was the fate that awaited us if the Japanese caught us trying to escape. There were two freight trucks parked on the side of the road. These trucks were en route to a Japanese military base in Fanling (up north in the New Territories of Hong Kong), as part of their regular delivery schedule, and so it would not arouse much suspicion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/b8f630ca-180b-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_972x_112248.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once we were all aboard the trucks, the drivers started the engines.

It was a small but sleepy fishing village. On the other side of the ocean was Guangdong, a part of Free China. Here was a glimpse of the freedom that awaited us. And for a brief moment, we felt a sense of liberation and joy. But all that quickly fell apart when one of the villagers informed our guides that the Japanese had wind of our presence in the area.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Unsung warriors set up in Sai Kung: the Hong Kong guerilla fighters who battled the Japanese in WW2</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They were coming for us. Some young boys from the village had spotted us from a distance while we were walking, and they informed the Japanese about us. These kids had been recruited as informers for the enemy, but they were too young to understand what was going on, or the significance of their actions. According to the villager, those boys had also informed the Japanese about the presence of many young women in our group. We were very troubled by this news. From the stories of the atrocities committed since the occupation, we knew for certain that the soldiers weren’t just coming for us, they were hungry for our women. It was not possible for us to sail away to safety. The boat was only scheduled to arrive at the jetty much later, in the early hours of the morning. Our guides began planning for a contingency. One of them found a small house far away from the jetty. We gathered the young women and hid them in a room inside that house together with all our possessions. The rest of us men were scattered all over the village. We acted as if we were busily preoccupied with some kind of work, as if we were a part of the community. On top of that, the guides sent some of us, myself included, onto a boat. There, we had to pretend that we were fishermen going about our usual routine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/37fbf162-180b-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_972x_112248.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We knew we needed a change in plans. It was no longer safe for us to wait for the boat to arrive at Sha Tau Kok. The Japanese soldiers may return again, and there would be no second chance. We would be like sitting ducks, highly vulnerable at any moment. The contingency plan was to abandon the boat, and walk over to “no-man’s land” on foot. This was a strip of land that was neither under the control of the Japanese, nor was it under the control of Chinese nationalist forces. It was a lawless land ruled by bandits. We regrouped and immediately made haste toward “no-man’s land”. In that moment of haste, we neglected stealth and were spotted by Japanese troops from a distance. They shouted curses at us and began pursuing us. The moment we heard their shouts, we began running for our lives. Fear and terror filled our hearts and minds. The only thought that raced through my head was: don’t look back, just keep running. After what felt like an eternity, we finally made it, all 25 of us. It was unbelievable! We made it into “no-man’s land”. We could no longer hear the shouts of our pursuers. The soldiers had given up chase. We had succeeded in fleeing from the Japanese. But that was not the end of our troubles. Now that we were in the lawless land of bandits, there was nothing but uncertainty. Would the bandits consider us friends or foe? Would they harm us or help us?</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Secret wartime agents who defied Japanese during occupation of Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chapter 14: Mission Accomplished</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">February 1, 1945</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few weeks had passed, and by now many of us new pilots were itching to join the fight against the Japanese.

I was incredibly surprised to see my name on the roster for the first time. I was to be co-pilot to a very experienced, senior Chinese pilot. It was a reconnaissance mission involving two B-25 Mitchells, which were twin-engined medium-sized bombers, with five or six crew members comprising the pilot, co-pilot, radio operator, navigator, and dorsal and rear gunners. It was an extremely versatile aircraft which could operate at low and medium altitudes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We were required to fly over an area a short distance away from our airbase to record the positions of the enemy.

Would they shoot us? Our aircraft flew over the Japanese troops, and I duly recorded their positions.

This time, it was the “real thing”, a strafing mission where we would attack enemy ground targets along the Nanyang Feng Cheng area by flying over them at a very low level. This was a risky operation, as we could get shot at such a low height. But we could not afford to be scared. Once you’re scared, you cannot perform during the mission. I had to completely focus all my concentration on the task at hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/ce2ce342-17ea-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_1320x770_112248.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once again we operated in a pair, and we took turns to deliver two strafing runs at the enemy. On our first pass over them, we strafed the column of enemy cavalry, causing the horses to panic, throwing the troops off their mount. The horses ran away, and I could see enemy troops dispersing from the highway, attempting to take cover. We made a second pass over them to ensure that we eliminated them completely. Our B-25 Mitchells flew so low over the ground, that I could see every vivid detail of the enemy troops. They were in a state of panic at the suddenness of the attack.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each time I opened up the machine guns to fire at them, I told myself that this was for all the cruel and evil things they had done to China and to my compatriots.

The locals in Singapore and Malaya started demanding opportunities for career advancement, and for key leadership appointments to be held by locals as well. This too was happening in Malayan Airways. Having embraced our new identity as citizens of Singapore, many of us local pilots felt that the new identity gave us a firmer resolve to fight for fairer treatment for our local staff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/c0f0da6e-17e8-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_1320x770_112248.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For me personally, as a Singaporean now, I saw no reason to remain a second-class pilot in the airline. For a long time, the local pilots had been tolerating the prejudices and discrimination. We were not just unhappy about being paid less than the expatriate pilots. We did not have a voice over organisational matters, and we were not allowed to take on senior positions and leadership roles. These were all reserved for the expatriates. Why should we be denied access to any of these because of our place of birth, or for the colour of our skin? These had nothing to do with skill or experience.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What infuriated us the most was the fact that the local pilots were never allowed to fly on our own. It was a rule that we had to be supervised by an expatriate pilot, even if he was a junior pilot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was the greatest insult. By now, there were 15 of us local pilots in Malayan Airways. We decided that it was necessary for us to band together so that we could negotiate fair terms of employment. On this day, we collectively agreed to set up a union, and we established the Malayan Airways Local Pilots Association. My fellow pilots appointed me to be the honorary secretary of the association, and I gladly accepted the role. I believed this was a battle that we needed to fight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/62c1a0ea-180b-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_972x_112248.jpg>In the weeks that followed, we soon realised that our efforts with the newly established association were not very effective. We were too few in numbers. There were 15 of us, against a much larger number of expatriate pilots. Driven by a strong desire to create a fair work environment for my fellow pilots, I approached the one man I knew I could trust. His name was <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lee Kuan Yew</span></a>. I had met Lee personally on several occasions. He was a regular passenger on my flights to Borneo. Lee was a lawyer and he was famous and highly respected in the expatriate circles for his eloquence and intellect. He was so well-respected and feared as a lawyer that he simply had to show up, and the expatriates would immediately assent to his demands. He did not even have to talk or make a case for it.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I approached Lee and told him about the plight of our local pilots. Without any hesitation, he agreed to help us. On the appointed day, Lee visited the Malayan Airways company to speak to our managing director. We were all present for that meeting, all 15 of us local pilots. What was truly remarkable about it was that before Lee could sit down on his chair, the managing director agreed to the terms of our request. In an instant, we got a pay increase that put every local pilot’s salary on par with our expatriate contemporaries. From that day forth, the expatriates learnt about our strength and stopped bullying us. They knew they had to be careful, especially since we had the support of Lee Kuan Yew.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Memoirs of a Flying Tiger is available at major bookstores and online</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGppbGFlfXl7x6SsZqukqrGmutNmrqiqnJl6uK3RZqCiZZOdtq%2Bx0p5kmqGiYrOwvsKeZKmhnKTBboWYZrCemaJivK2wjKGm</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fhku-student-world-war-ii-chinese-air-force-pilot-99-year-old-ho.html&title=From%20HKU%20student%20to%20World%20War%20II%20Chinese%20air%20force%20pilot%2c%2099-year-old%20Ho%20Weng%20Toh%20looks%20back%20on%20his%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhku-student-world-war-ii-chinese-air-force-pilot-99-year-old-ho.html&description=From%20HKU%20student%20to%20World%20War%20II%20Chinese%20air%20force%20pilot%2c%2099-year-old%20Ho%20Weng%20Toh%20looks%20back%20on%20his%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhku-student-world-war-ii-chinese-air-force-pilot-99-year-old-ho.html&title=From%20HKU%20student%20to%20World%20War%20II%20Chinese%20air%20force%20pilot%2c%2099-year-old%20Ho%20Weng%20Toh%20looks%20back%20on%20his%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fhku-student-world-war-ii-chinese-air-force-pilot-99-year-old-ho.html&title=From%20HKU%20student%20to%20World%20War%20II%20Chinese%20air%20force%20pilot%2c%2099-year-old%20Ho%20Weng%20Toh%20looks%20back%20on%20his%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fhku-student-world-war-ii-chinese-air-force-pilot-99-year-old-ho.html&text=From%20HKU%20student%20to%20World%20War%20II%20Chinese%20air%20force%20pilot%2c%2099-year-old%20Ho%20Weng%20Toh%20looks%20back%20on%20his%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fhku-student-world-war-ii-chinese-air-force-pilot-99-year-old-ho.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Aldo Pusey</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-03-28</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./is-evan-peters-gay-or-bi-truth-behind-his-sexuality-577422-html.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Is Evan Peters Gay Or Bi?
