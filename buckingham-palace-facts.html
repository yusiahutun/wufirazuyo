In 1761, King George III bought the property to serve as a private home for his wife and children. Located near the royal family’s official residence at the St James’ Palace, the Buckingham Palace served as their private retreat.</p><p>In 1837, Queen Victoria sat on the throne, making the palace her official residence.

The zoolitic limestones which make up the walls may have something to do with that, too. These limestones are made of small spherical clumps of sedimentary rocks.</p><p>According to research, this rock is formed from the mineralized remains of tiny organisms that can be found in grains of sand and grit. With that, the tiny <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>fossils</a> that make up the palace’s walls date back to around 200 million years ago. Similarly, other famous landmarks like the Pentagon and the Empire State Building use these rocks for their structures.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>The Buckingham Palace suffered damages from World War 2.</h2><p>When the war broke out, King George IV sat on the royal family’s throne. The British government wanted the King and his family to flee London, but King George did not heed their advice. Because of this, Queen Elizabeth and their kids did not leave the palace as well. According to the Queen, the children would not leave unless she does, and she would not go anywhere without the King.</p><p>Since the King didn’t want to abandon the country regardless of the circumstances, the royal family stayed in the palace together. She had a firm resolve to stay with King George, so she practiced pistol firing with stray rats as targets.

Authorities also found out that he had been inside the palace many times without being caught. Now, there’s one for weird Buckingham Palace facts.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>Buckingham Palace houses hundreds of people.</h2><p>Although we know the Buckingham Palace as a royal residence, it’s not only a place for the monarchs. Not only does it house Queen Elizabeth and her family, but more than 800 staff call it home. With 188 staff rooms, 52 guest and royal bedrooms, 19 staterooms, 78 bathrooms, and 92 offices, someone has to help maintain its prestige.</p><p>That said, Buckingham has more than enough space and rooms for the Royal family to occupy alone.

These Buckingham Palace facts are just amazing in their own way.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>The Buckingham Palace is only open for public visits during summer.</h2><p>Since it’s the royal family’s residence, it’s not practical for its doors to always be open to the public. However, the Palace State Rooms stay open for visits between August and September. When the Queen’s off for summer holidays in Scotland, the public is allowed to visit the palace.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>There's a trick to know if the Queen is at Buckingham Palace.</h2><p>It’s not every day that you get to see the Queen. If you’re planning to test your luck, there’s a signal that will increase your chances of seeing her. Your luck will be determined by the waving flag in the palace. If you see the Royal Standard flag, that’s a good thing. Stay for a while, and maybe you’d get a glimpse of the Queen.</p><p>On the flip side, the Union Flag indicates that she’s not there at all. The Royal Standard flag will also be seen on her aircraft and cars when she’s on official travels. Definitely one of the Buckingham Palace facts to keep in mind if you want to visit.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Buckingham Palace is like a village of its own.</h2><p>Besides its sprawling grounds and throne room, a lot of things happen inside its walls.

On the way to a Paris conference, they just squeezed in a visit to the iconic palace. Upon their arrival, King George V held a gathering and threw a banquet for the president.This event also marked the beginning of the tradition where the head of state or the president of the US visits the royal residence every now and then. After this, a series of visits to the palace then became normal. One particularly memorable instance during these visits was in 1977, when then-President Jimmy Carter broke protocol when he gave Queen Elizabeth a kiss on the lips.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/buckingham-palace-730x487.jpeg><h2 class=content-title id=title-11>The Buckingham Palace was a Girl Guide Headquarters back in the day.</h2><p>Before she became Queen, Princess Elizabeth was active in the Girl Guides, much like the Girl Scouts in the US. Together with her sister, Princess Margaret, and her troops, they organized the company at their royal home. Between the years 1937 and 1939, the Girl Guide Company held their meetings at the palace grounds and the summerhouse. Out of the 30 Girl Guides members, two were princesses, while the rest were the children of palace employees and other royal families.

The organization carried on until 1963, eventually coming to a halt in 1963 when Princess Anne went to boarding school.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-12>About 60,000 sandwiches are consumed in Buckingham Palace every year.</h2><p>The Queen hosts a lot of parties every year, with at least three garden parties held in the palace’s private garden every summer.

The family appears regularly during Trooping the Color, which is a yearly event for the sovereign’s birthday. Invitees of the event include the Queen’s descendants and other family members. The balcony is also part of many royal weddings, jubilees, major state occasions, and coronations. The very first royal couple to kiss on the balcony in front of the public crowd was Lady Diana and Prince Charles. However, not every royal couple had the chance to appear on the balcony on their wedding day, since some marry outside of their London residence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/library-of-congress-hdcE2sel_Yk-unsplash.jpg><h2 class=content-title id=title-16>The waving of the royals at the Buckingham Palace's balcony has been a tradition.</h2><p>Over the years, the royal family developed a signature balcony wave that Queen Victoria started in the year 1851.

Meanwhile, there would only be 2 when she’s away.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-18>Buckingham Palace's grandest State Room is the White Drawing Room.</h2><p>The Palace State Rooms primarily serve the purpose of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>entertaining</a> and receiving guests. Each room has its own function, depending on the occasion. The rooms reflect King George IV’s taste, since he commissioned its architectural design. Throughout the palace, you will find 19 State Rooms, each prestigious in its own way. However, the White Drawing Room is the grandest of them all.</p><p>Before you enter this room, you will need to pass through an enormous door concealed by mirrors and side cabinets.

At the time when the uniforms were made, the color red was one of the country’s cheapest dyes, with the royal family choosing it to save a few pounds for the cost of these uniforms. It also serves as a military strategy, as red is a difficult color to see from a distance. Thus, enemies had a hard time identifying how many guards and British soldiers they will be facing head-on.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-24>The Buckingham Palace receives at least 300 letters every day for the Queen.</h2><p>According to a source, the palace receives at least 300 letters every day which could be an overwhelming amount for the Queen to handle.

For over 900 years, Windsor has been a fortress for the royal family as one of the world’s largest occupied castles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/royal-guard-1815020_1280.jpg><h2 class=content-title id=title-26>Buckingham Palace hires only the best soldiers in the country.</h2><p>If you think that the royal guards perform an easy job of just standing and guarding the castle, you got it all wrong. To be part of the royal guard post, they have to be highly trained and qualified soldiers. Only those who have fought for the country with great distinction can qualify for the job. Traditionally, the guards will have limited chances to move.</p><p>Of course, they can move every ten minutes or so by marching or walking down in their sentry box.
