The lawsuit, brought by anti-abortion group Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, asks the Donald Trump–appointed judge to order the Food and Drug Administration to repeal its approval of the drug, effectively pulling it from the market and altering the state of medication abortion nationwide.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Medication abortion, an alternative to the traditional surgical procedure, accounted for more than half of abortions performed in the United States as of 2020, and the method has taken on even greater significance in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a39917317/post-roe-abortion-care-rlc/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="post-Roe world" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">post-Roe world</a> as a growing number of states restrict or ban abortion. Mifepristone, the drug at the center of the Texas case, is used in 98 percent of these abortions—alongside a second medication, misoprostol—to terminate pregnancies at up to 10 weeks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The lawsuit alleges, however, that the medication’s approval by the FDA more than 20 years ago was not properly evaluated and should not have made mifepristone available via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. If Kacsmaryk rules in favor of the case, granting the request for a preliminary injunction to remove mifepristone from the market, it could result in a nationwide ban on the widely utilized abortion pill—even in safe-haven states, like California and New York.</p><img alt="a nurse shows the ru486 pill at the family planning department of hopital broussais, 25 october 2000 photo by manoocher deghati afp photo by manoocher deghatiafp via getty images" title=FRANCE-HEALTH-RU486 width=1024 height=666 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1211989800-6410e18ce5224.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MANOOCHER DEGHATI</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was an arduous process to get [mifepristone] approved,” Melissa Grant, the cofounder and COO of abortion care provider Carafem, tells BAZAAR.com. The drug, which was developed in France in 1980 and rolled out across Europe in the subsequent decade, became the subject of three clinical trials in the United States, one of which she participated in early in her career. “In 1996, more than 15 years after mifepristone came out, the FDA finally decided to go ahead and approve it, and it still sat for another four years before it was finally approved,” Grant says. “So it’s white noise and political maneuvering to say that this drug was approved in some way that was not thoughtful. It’s a politically motivated decision instigated by extremists.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Texas case comes as just a small piece in a much bigger attack on abortion, one that abortion providers and activists have been fending off for years. This only escalated during the pandemic, when suddenly, patients were confined to their homes and health care was mostly limited to telemedicine. Even so, some in the field saw these difficulties as ample opportunity to expand abortion access.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We were seeing digital health companies focusing on stigmatized issues in men’s health take off and I thought, This could be a model for safe, discreet, affordable abortion access,” recalls Kiki Freedman, cofounder of Hey Jane, a virtual clinic that offers telemedicine abortion care. Since 2021, the provider has helped 25,000 patients receive private, safe, supportive, accessible and convenient care—largely with the help of mailed medication abortion.</p><img alt="topshot abortion rights activists rally in front of the us supreme court in washington, dc, on may 21, 2019 demonstrations were planned across the us on tuesday in defense of abortion rights, which activists see as increasingly under attack the day of action rallies come after the state of alabama passed the countrys most restrictive abortion ban, prohibiting the procedure in all cases, even rape and incest, unless the mothers life is at risk alabama is among about 14 states which have adopted laws banning or drastically restricting access to abortion, according to activists photo by andrew caballero reynolds afp photo by andrew caballero reynoldsafp via getty images" title=TOPSHOT-us-politics-abortion-protest-social width=1024 height=723 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1145343779-6410e1de25c1a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pandemic initially allowed for this expansion of medication abortion access, when the in-person dispensing requirement for abortion pills was lifted in the summer of 2020, but a challenge by the Trump administration in January 2021 soon reinstated the in-person requirement. A few months later, the FDA decided not to enforce the requirement for the duration of the pandemic, and in December 2021, the suspension was made permanent. But many abortion providers saw the writing on the wall and knew that this wouldn’t be the end of the telehealth medication abortion discussion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Dobbs decision last June, which immediately made abortion illegal or extremely difficult to access in a number of states, has only heightened the importance of medication abortion. Patients living in states where abortion is restricted have found ways to obtain medication abortion from across state lines, whether through legal means or through alternative routes without clinician involvement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In states that unjustly restrict access to abortion care through mainstream medical clinics, we know that abortion pills obtained through alternate sources have played a huge role in helping people access safe abortion,” says Elisa Wells, the cofounder and co-director of Plan C, a nonprofit organization and campaign for access to medication abortion. “We estimate that just since the Dobbs decision, 30,000 to 40,000 people or more have obtained abortion pills through these alternate sources and safely self-managed their abortions.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If Judge Kacsmaryk does rule in favor of the Texas lawsuit, as he is expected to any day now, mifepristone could be pulled from the market, leaving many patients without a safe or accessible path to terminate pregnancy, even in states where surgical abortion remains available. “I couldn’t afford a surgical abortion, and I didn’t want it to show up on my insurance since I didn’t tell my parents at the time,” recalls Hannah Partin, who at 22 years old underwent a dual-medication abortion in New York City. “I think not having medication abortion as an option would have really impacted my thinking around having an abortion, even if it wouldn’t have changed the outcome.”</p><img alt="pro choice activists supporting legal access to abortion protest during a demonstration outside the us supreme court in washington, dc, march 4, 2020, as the court hears oral arguments regarding a louisiana law about abortion access in the first major abortion case in years the united states supreme court on wednesday will hear what may be its most significant case in decades on the controversial subject of abortion at issue is a state law in louisiana which requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital photo by saul loeb afp photo by saul loebafp via getty images" title=US-HEALTH-ABORTION-POLITICS-COURT width=1024 height=668 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1205059909-6410e1ed08aff.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">SAUL LOEB</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Many patients may soon find themselves in similar positions if the Texas ruling on mifepristone forces abortion providers to stop offering the foremost medication abortion method.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is unclear what long-term impact the decision will have, and some in the health care space remain hopeful that FDA law will take precedent over Kacsmaryk’s decision. But even with the future of mifepristone unknown, many abortion providers have begun preparing for the worst and are creating alternative treatment plans to offer patients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Carafem, which began offering telemedicine abortion care in 2017, it was obvious back in 2020 that mifepristone was not always a perfect solution. “We’ve always tried to predict possibilities around decreasing access, and we found during the Trump administration that there was threat to the ongoing ability to mail mifepristone,” Grant says. “So, in 2020, we implemented a second option for medication abortion, in addition to the gold standard of mifepristone and misoprostol together, and that was to provide medication abortion through misoprostol alone.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In countries around the world where mifepristone is not available, misoprostol is the most commonly used medication and can successfully end early pregnancy up to 95 percent of the time. Carafem has continued to offer misoprostol alone as a secondary option and is prepared to shift to misoprostol exclusively if forced; it’s just one of several routes that abortion providers could take in response to the imminent Texas decision.</p><img alt="mifepristone mifeprex and misoprostol, the two drugs used in a medication abortion, are seen at the womens reproductive clinic, which provides legal medication abortion services, in santa teresa, new mexico, on june 17, 2022 mifepristone is taken first to stop the pregnancy, followed by misoprostol to induce bleeding in the wake of fridays ruling by the us supreme court striking down roe v wade and the federally protected right to an abortion, women from texas and other states are traveling to clinics like the womens reproductive health clinic in new mexico for legal abortion services under the states more liberal laws restricted to editorial use photo by robyn beck afp restricted to editorial use photo by robyn beckafp via getty images" title=US-ABORTION-TEXAS-NEWMEXICO-CLINIC width=1024 height=682 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1241524154-6410e357d2852.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ROBYN BECK</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We know that many providers plan to continue to provide mifepristone prescriptions, while others are also prepared to switch to a misoprostol-only regimen, which we know is also safe and effective,” Plan C’s Wells says. “We also know that mifepristone plus misoprostol pills will remain available through the network of alternate suppliers we list in our Guide to Pills, so we are shoring up that information in anticipation of the ruling.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Planned Parenthood, one of the largest and most well-known abortion providers in the country, for its part has pledged its continued commitment to doing whatever possible to ensure patients can choose the method of abortion that is best for their circumstances, including medication abortion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some legal experts also predict that the Texas ruling could have much farther effects, going well beyond just mifepristone. “The potential broader implications are definitely top of mind for Hey Jane,” Freedman admits. “If a court is able to reverse FDA approval on mifepristone, other crucial medications in reproductive health care could also be threatened.” These could include misoprostol, as well as medications outside of abortion, like birth control—despite continued data showing that these are all safe medications that can be safely distributed by mail.<br></p><img alt="asheville, north carolina, usa may 4, 2015 older women hold signs saying politicians make crappy doctors to protest north carolinas abortion bill 465 which increases restrictions for women seeking abortions, may 4, 2015 in downtown asheville, nc" title="Women Protest North Carolina Abortion Restriction" width=2015 height=1487 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-473054134-6410e1ae70fd7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">AwakenedEye</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even in the event that the Texas decision has no impact on the availability of mifepristone or any other drug, the case has already added misinformation and fear to existing confusion around abortion. Right now, only one in three adults knows medication abortion exists, and providers continue to face an uphill battle when trying to advertise their services or spread awareness about abortion options.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We constantly have to fight advertising partners to even use words like abortion,” says Monica Cepak, the CMO of Wisp, an online provider of reproductive health care. The telehealth company and countless others that provide information on or access to abortion experience ongoing censorship from social media platforms and regularly see their posts and accounts removed or suppressed simply for sharing medically accurate information.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We all have to cut through a significant amount of white noise, and it only makes it harder for the person sitting at home to know who’s real and who’s not and where to find real, reliable information on abortion,” Grant, of Carafem, says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This noise will only get louder, she predicts, if mifepristone’s FDA approval is revoked or further called into question. “Using medication abortion has proven to help people make their own private medical decisions, it expands access to care, reduces stigma, and takes some of the burden off of health care clinics that are already overflowing with demand,” Grant explains. “Taking it away will create a further burden for those trying to receive care and will ultimately have a negative impact on maternal health. So this is very concerning for those of us who want to provide options to keep people safe and healthy, and it’s not going to stop anytime soon.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/dee82b59-b1dd-4567-8708-767d458cac9c_1558034834.png alt="Headshot of Gabby Shacknai" title="Headshot of Gabby Shacknai" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Gabby Shacknai is a New York-based journalist and editor who produces high-quality content for a wide variety of outlets and brands across various industries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGion6G2tbXCrGaabGNofnl8k3BmpZmnqMKqwIytnLGZo2K3trDGnmSamp%2Bnwaq7zWanoqScYrqqssSpqaKrpKS7pnnAnJqeq6Nk</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2flawsuit-texas-judge-abortion-pill-mifepristone-access.html&title=A%20Lawsuit%20in%20Texas%20Could%20Threaten%20Abortion%20Pill%20Access%20in%20the%20U.S." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flawsuit-texas-judge-abortion-pill-mifepristone-access.html&description=A%20Lawsuit%20in%20Texas%20Could%20Threaten%20Abortion%20Pill%20Access%20in%20the%20U.S." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flawsuit-texas-judge-abortion-pill-mifepristone-access.html&title=A%20Lawsuit%20in%20Texas%20Could%20Threaten%20Abortion%20Pill%20Access%20in%20the%20U.S." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2flawsuit-texas-judge-abortion-pill-mifepristone-access.html&title=A%20Lawsuit%20in%20Texas%20Could%20Threaten%20Abortion%20Pill%20Access%20in%20the%20U.S." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2flawsuit-texas-judge-abortion-pill-mifepristone-access.html&text=A%20Lawsuit%20in%20Texas%20Could%20Threaten%20Abortion%20Pill%20Access%20in%20the%20U.S." onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2flawsuit-texas-judge-abortion-pill-mifepristone-access.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Martina Birk</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-10</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./how-to-do-your-own-nails.html><h3>&lt;&lt; How To Do Your Own Nails, Perfectly</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./iwa-moto.html><h3>Who is Iwa Moto dating?
